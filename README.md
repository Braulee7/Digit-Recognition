# Digit-Recognition
Recreated an older project to train a neural network to recognise hand written digits. The hello
world of Machine Learning as some refer to it.

Using the tensorflow keras api I trained the model on the mnist data set to attempt to categorise
hand written digits correctly. I used the tkinter module to allow users to draw their own digits
and test the model by checking what they have written and see what the model predicts it to be.
